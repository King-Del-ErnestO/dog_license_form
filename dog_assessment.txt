What questions would you ask the client?

I'd like to gather some important information like, how did you get the dog?
Is he lawfully yours? Are you capable of taking care of the dog? Do you plan on
getting more dogs in future?
I'd also get the owner's information and dog's information for the license.
I'd like to know:
Owner's Name(s)
Owner's Address(home,city,state,country)
Owner's Telephone Number
Owner's Email
Owner's Gender
Owner's means of identification
Next I'd like to get:
Dog's Name
Dog's Color(s)
Dog's Gender
Dog's breed
Dog's name tag

For a license, vaccination is key i'd like to get that information too.
